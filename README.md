# crypto-ticker
Chrome extension that allows users to view real-time values of chosen cryptocurrencies.

## How to install
This extension is not on the Chrome Web Store. In order to insert this into your Chrome browser, unzip the downloaded folder and drag it into your Chrome browser when visiting your [Extensions Page] (chrome://extensions/), and it should be added to Chrome.

## Motivation
Over the summer, I've been looking closely into the cryptocurrency market, especially after it blew up in June 2017. I created this to be able to more readily check my favorite currencies on the fly.
